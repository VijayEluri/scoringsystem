To set up a team:
 - telnet localhost 8080
ENTER: admin()
ENTER: admin password
ENTER: createteam("TEAM_NAME").sethost("TEAM_HOST")

To set up a service:
 - telnet localhost 8080
ENTER: admin()
ENTER: admin password
ENTER: createservice("SERVICE_NAME").setscript("SCRIPT_FILENAME")

SCRIPT_FILENAME is the filename of the testscript. All testscripts
must lie in scripts/ . Note that you can specify something like
"../foo" as SCRIPT_FILENAME to break out of the scripts/ directory.
However, this is not recommended.
