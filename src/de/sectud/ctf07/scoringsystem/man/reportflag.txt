Flags are 32 byte values represented by 64 byte hex strings.

The function to report flags is
  <b>boolean reportflag(int teamID, string flagID)</b>
Returns true if the flag was credited, otherwise false.

If you are team #4 and you believe you found a flag, say,
1337, you'd enter:
  <b>reportflag(4, "1337")</b>
done!
