Advisories must contain exact source line specifications (service
name, filename, line number) or they cannot be processed. This rule is
necessary because the moderators (probably) have not written the
reported services themselves and need a way to verify the validity of
your advisory.


The function to report an advisory is
  <b>boolean reportadvisory(int teamID, String advisory)</b>
The function to read a multiline string is
  <b>String readtext()</b>
readtext() reads lines from stdin (in your case, the network connection)
until it reads a line containing a single dot (^\.$).

This is how I reported an advisory for team #7:
(entered text is typeset bold)
  scorebot> <b>reportadvisory(7, readtext())</b>
  
  Write some text, finish with a single dot on a separate line (^\.$)
  <b>The tcsh is vunerable to a social engineering attack.
  By getting an admin to open a root shell and than taking
  a coffee break, you can break his computer by simple writing:
  # rm -rf /*
  Fix:
  remove tcsh (and while you're at it, all other shells as well)
  from your machines
  .</b>
  Your advisory has been reported.
